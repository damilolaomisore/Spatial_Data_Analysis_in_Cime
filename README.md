# Spatial_Data_Analysis_in_Cime
Crime has been a reoccurring phenomenon affecting most if not all communities and societies worldwide. To subdue this, crime analysis has been adopted to provide timely and useful information on crime patterns and trends. For this work, I reviewed different spatial data analysis techniques that have been used for crime analysis such as spatial regression analysis, spatial clustering, and hot spot analysis. Also discussed, criticized and pointed out the advantages and bottlenecks of these techniques. At the end of the paper, I concluded with a summary of the other spatial data analysis techniques also used for crime analysis.
